Visualizing ***"The Indicator"*** podcast


So far this year, real disposable income per capita in the U.S. has gone up by about 6 percent year-to-date from last year. Right now, it's on track to reach the fastest rate of growth since 1984.

This raises one big question: How? The United States has experienced an economic shock that's left millions of people out of work â€” and on top of that, the economic recovery seems to be slowing. How could disposable income have possibly risen at such a rapid pace?

Cardiff and Stacey break down the strangest economic indicator of the year.
